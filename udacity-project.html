  	  	<div class="section-title">Client and Server</div>
  	  		<div class="concept-content">
  	   			Basic concepts such as client and server were introduced. The concept of marked up or coded text files residing on a server being retreived using the HTTP protocol by the client and decoded by the browser was introduced.  It was made clear that the web runs on HTML that's been marked up or formatted. Several tools were introduced; including, Codepen.io and Scratchpad.io.  A small gem was also referenced to help us look up HTML and CSS resources over at www.w3schools.com.

  		<div class="section-title">Markup Language, including Inline & Block</div>
  	 		<div class="concept-content">
  	 			Introductory details about marking up text so that it could be formatted for HTML were covered.  Several tags were introduced.  The B, EM, P, IMG, BR, and A were all demonstrated.In one demonstration multiple tags were used together.  The explanation about the inline versus the block was very clarifying.  I've been out of the business for many years (since 1996).  Describing the block as having an imaginary box around it made things very clear.

  		<div class="section-title">Just Following Orders</div>
  			<div class="concept-content">
	  			The concept of computers simply following what they're told to do was stressed.  An example of not closing a tag was used to demonstrate this.  While a person could easily spot this, there is no artificial intelligence that the computer employs to detect our errors.  It just follows our orders.

	<h2>Lesson 2 - Intro to Structured HTML and CSS</h2>
    <div class="concept"><!-- Concept 1-->
		
	    	<div class="section-title">Intro to HTML and CSS - Page Structure and Design</div>
	    		<div class="concept-content">
		  			Imagine taking a visual design (think image) and making it into a web site.
					You could receive a PDF File and use it to design the basics of your web site.
	  			<p>
					HTML is like a house or the structure.  CSS is like the decoration in the house - the walls, carpet color, etc.  Javascript files are the interactive part of the home - like tv remote or garage door.  There are rules to where these can be placed.
	  			</p>
	  			<p>
					Web tools are available to help us organize our designs - Sublime Text 2 is one. We reviewed wikipedia using Chrome's built in development tools or 'inspector'. Specificially we analyzed the heirarchy and structure of content on wikipedia - seeing lots of highlighted boxes and divisions. Digging deeper into tags we could see the same text as shown to the wikipedia reader on the rendered page.  HTML is the language - syntax + rule = tags into elements.  Everything in between is content and has name/type attributes and values as needed.
	  			</p>
	  			<p>
	  				Document Object Module, or DOM, Tree is built from HTML DOC.

	<div class="concept"><!-- Concept2 Div -->
  		<div class="section-title">CSS Boxes, Grids, and Design</div>
  			<div class="concept-content">
   	  			CSS determins the style through syntax rules. It can change how elements look - Their size font, order, position. For example all h1 class article should be blue if we called for this behavior.  All elements have imaginary outlines or boxes around them - and are styled with CSS.
   	  			Squares can be turned into circles with the proper CSS styling.
			<p>
				When performing the high level design - Think Squares/Boxes! Squares/Boxes help us visualize layout of our design.  They also makes it possible to move things around more easily.  For example - the same space could be used to swap images with text.  Use boxes to outline your content - Move from big boxes to small boxes - ignore specific content detail.  Just look for blocks.

		<div class="section-title">Structured Understanding Leads to Expertise</div>
	  		<div class="concept-content">
	  			Bridging the Novice to Expert knowledge gap is made possible by having a structured understanding of the information presented. Having a structured understanding comes through reflection which is transpiring as I post processing what I've learned and through good note taking.  
	  		<p>
				Good ideas can then become possible because of my understanding and ability to execute.

    <div class="concept"><!-- Concept 1-->
		
	    	<div class="section-title">Overview and Reminders</div>
	    		<div class="concept-content">
		  			CSS code used to add style.  <span class="highlight">Concept of avoiding repetition</span> - helps make efficient code.  HTML tells the browser where to find the style info - found in the head tag.
	  			<p>
					Example app html file and style.css files were demonstrated.  We turned the description style text color to red to demonstrate. Scratchpad.io was shown as an alternative to demonstrate the css inside the same html doc.
	  			</p>
	  			</div>
    </div>		
	<div class="concept"><!-- Concept2 Div -->
  		<div class="section-title">Definitions</div>
  			<div class="concept-content">
   	  			Definition of CSS was declared as Cascading Style Sheets.  The C was the most important because of the cascading effect.  A short demo showed how em was still pink but it makes sense because despite em being declared as pink, it was contained within an h1 that was declared to be pink.
			</div>
	</div>
	<div class="concept"><!-- concept 3 Div -->
		<div class="section-title">Concepts</div>
	  		<div class="concept-content">
	  			What does CSS mean then?  In general Style – but really, rules.  CSS is a bit of the reverse of our legal system where - National Laws, State Laws, Municipality Laws, and House Rules are applied. <span class="highlight">CSS most specific rules are applied to all elements! - This is what Cascading Means. This is powerful and efficient! CSS looks for the rule that best describes the element in question and it is then applied.</span>  
	  		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="concept"><!-- concept 4 Div -->
		<div class="section-title">Characteristics</div>
	  		<div class="concept-content">
	  			Inheritance was introduced and explains the pink example up above.  The wiki (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#Inheritance) states "... Descendant elements may inherit CSS property values from any ancestor element enclosing them ..."  The distinction was made that inheritance applies to text but not box related properties.  Specifically, these can be inherited, "color, font, letter-spacing, line-height, list-style, text-align, text-indent, text-transform, visibility, white-space and word-spacing.”  Several others are also not inherited, including: "background, border, display, float and clear, height and width, margin, min- and max-height and -width, outline, overflow, padding, position, text-decoration, vertical-align and z-index."  <span class="highlight">The inheritance property allows for much less code repetition!</span>  
	  		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="concept"><!-- concept 5 Div -->
		<div class="section-title">Application Syntax and Reference</div>
	  		<div class="concept-content">
	  			CSS is written and applied in the following formats: Selector: we tell it what elements it will apply to.  In this case it could be the h1 tag – and will apply to each and every h1 tag.  We could also write the style attribute:description and apply it to a defined class – much more control and granularity here.  CSS reference documentation was introduced - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference.  And a quick intro article was introduced here - https://css-tricks.com/how-css-selectors-work/.  Several font-style properties were reviewed as well as font-weight to make it look bold.  We can place CSS in the head of the HTML, in the CSS file outside of HTML, or <span class="highlight">inline with the HTML which is undesirable because it leads to repetition which CSS was designed to avoid.</span> Note: CSS comments begin with forward slash and asterisk and end opposite.
	  		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="concept"><!-- concept 6 Div -->
		<div class="section-title">Demonstration</div>
	  		<div class="concept-content">
	  			Demo 2 and Demo 3 highlighted the power of CSS.   The HTML remained unchanged – only the CSS file was adjusted to render a more polished look.  Use proper markup – using H1 instead of the div tag in this case.  Search engines use these to index.  
	  		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="concept"><!-- concept 7 Div -->
		<div class="section-title">Box Attributes, Sizing, and Positioning</div>
	  		<div class="concept-content">
	  			Positioning Boxes and the Model with 4 components: Margins – provides area around the border – space between boxes, Border – goes around padding and content, Padding – clears an area around the content, Content – the image or text shown (the nucleus) other layers protect it, Element Width = left border, left pad, content width, right padding, right border.
			<p>	
				CSS style box-sizing border-box = calcs border and padding – just set width of overall box; padding and border remain the same.   Boxes can be set in Pixel or Percentage.  Percentage renders better as page size is adjusted.  Max-width can also be set and must be less than 100% for flexbox.  Positioning – the most complicated concept – so they don’t take the entire line. Flex box layout was introduced.  Several elements or divs can be next to each other using flexbox in the CSS. Note: Use an ALT on image tags in case browser can’t show the image.
  			</p>

	<div class="concept"><!-- concept 8 Div -->
		<div class="section-title">Development Process, Tools, and Error Correction</div>
	  		<div class="concept-content">
	  			Code, Test, Refine was our process to build.  Look for natural boxes.    Look for repeated styles and semantic styles. Write my html. <span class="highlight">Apply styles from biggest to smallest.</span> Fix and try to view in other browsers.
	  		<p>
				Dev Tools can be a big help during refinement – we can modify attributes on the fly.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ensure HTML and CSS are written in compliance to the standards.
				Test your <a href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">html</a>, and <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input">css</a> to ensure they are free of errors and in compliance.

				<li>Exploring List Properties: You'll explore the difference between concatenating two lists with the + operator and appending with .append(). You'll also be introduced to a new operator +=.</li>

				<li>Good lesson on adding vs appending:
					<ul>
						<li>def list_test(l1,l2,l3):
							<ul>
							    <li>l1.append('a')</li>
							    <li>l2.append('a')</li>
							    <li>l2.append('b')</li>
							    <li>l2.append('c')</li>
							    <li>l3 = l3 + ['w']   #this one got me because I'm used to not using these brackets.  It also didn't mutate the l3.</li>
							    <li>return l3</li>
							</ul>

				<li>lists
					<ul>
						<li>first_input = [1,2,3]</li>
						<li>second_input = [4,5,6]</li>
						<li>third_input = [7,8,9]</li>
